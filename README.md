Rhapsody
===

A WordPress base theme, loosely based on Underscores. Uses laravel elixir for front-end tasks, Yarn for dependency management and Susy for grids. Contains a basic offcanvas navigation for mobile. Meant to be lightweight and to quickly get your project up to speed.

I use this theme along with Bedrock, from Roots, along with a Capistrano deployment strategy.
